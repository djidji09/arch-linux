# arch-linux
## arch-linux's setup
if the the wifi interface is software blocked you can do this 
```  
rfkill list
rfkill unblock all
```
```  
iwctl
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect YOUR_WIFI_NAME
```
once the wifi is turned on we use the archinstall script to install linux
```  
archinstall
```
follow the install and dont forget to get "wget" as additional packages because we are gonna use it to get omarchy

## omarchy's setup

```  
wget -qO- https://omarchy.org/install | bash
```
## configuration 
### first copy all the dot files into there correct path

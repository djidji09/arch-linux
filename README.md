# arch-linux
## arch-linux's setup
if the the wifi interface is software blocked you can do this 
```terminal 
rfkill list
rfkill unblock all
```
```terminal 
iwctl
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect YOUR_WIFI_NAME
```
once the wifi is turned on we use the archinstall script to install linux
```terminal 
archinstall
```
follow the install and dont forget to get "wget" as additional packages because we are gonna use it to get omarchy

## omarchy's setup

```terminal 
wget -qO- https://omarchy.org/install | bash
```

sudo mkdir mnt/shared
```
then we mount the selected drive shown with the command "lsblk"
```terminal 
sudo mount /dev/sda9 /mnt/shared
```
then we create a shortcut of the drive
```terminal 
ln -s /mnt/shared/ ~/djidji/shared
```
